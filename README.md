Designing effective cloud-native architectures on Azure often feels overwhelming—especially when trying to translate complex requirements into reliable solutions. This book solves that problem by giving you a structured, visual guide to building modern systems that are scalable, secure, and production-ready.
You’ll discover how to plan, design, and communicate Azure-based architectures using practical reference diagrams mapped to real-world use cases. Organized by domain including infrastructure, applications, data, container orchestrators, AI and security—each chapter walks you through the key services, patterns, and decisions that underpin successful solutions.
Throughout the book, you’ll find over 40 detailed architecture maps, created and curated by a seasoned Microsoft cloud solution architect. These maps illustrate how to align Azure services with business goals, manage hybrid and multi-cloud complexity, and incorporate best practices for governance, resilience, and cost optimization.
This book gives you more than just diagrams,it offers the confidence to design cloud solutions that scale and perform. Whether you're modernizing a legacy stack or building greenfield applications, the Azure Cloud Native Architecture Mapbook is your trusted design companion from concept to delivery.</details>
